            <h2>Daydreams</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a child, I've always had my face buried in some type of technology. Computers, TVs, game consoles, and everything in between. Every minute spent with technology was like I was being drip fed high concentrated amounts of dopamine. My family always told me that I had a future in tech, and while it seemed exciting, I never really took it seriously. I would just consume all that technology had to offer, because that's what was put in front of me. I would constantly daydream about creating that next big video game, website, or animation with the latest tools, but as a child, you kind of go through phases, always discovering. I didn't even have my own computer to do the things I always dreamt of doing, so I just continued on living what are supposed to be "the best times of your life."</p>
            <h2>Blurry</h2>
            <p>Even with the thousands of hours of experience addicted to technology, I still never truly applied myself in creating something, though I dabbled in it here and there. Graduating high school was a bittersweet experience, in that I was free to do whatever I wanted, yet I was too comfortable being... comfortable. I never had this sense of urgency to do anything outside of my comfort zone, even though my mind was constantly itching to break outside of my usual norm. My young adult years went by in such a dull way, sometimes I wonder if they even existed. A bit of college, tense relationships, scattered friendships... Life was going by in a non-exciting blur.</p>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>After years of a seemingly neverending onslaught of issues, including the infamous COVID outbreak, I decided that I needed to do something different. I had to teach myself to go beyond what I was used to, even if sometimes I felt alone through it all. Eventually I happened upon a company that was offering to teach people the basics of HTML all the way up to learning about React. There was even some talks about apprenticeships being handed out, as long as you showed passion. I'll be honest, I almost didn't go, even after I paid what little I had just to partake in the classes. I pushed through my pessimistic thoughts and attended anyways, and I think without that action, I wouldn't even be making this portfolio. I was still uncertain about the future, but being in those classes showed me that I was capable of not just actively pursuing my own goals, but that I also had the ability to lift up others that were also in my place of spiraling anxiety.</p>
            <h2>Apprenticeship</h2>
            <p>Before I was to begin taking my JavaScript class, I was offered an apprenticeship, and from then on... I still didn't really take myself seriously.</p>
            <h2>Something Clicked...</h2>
            <p>After the apprenticeship, and some time just mulling around, something in my brain clicked. I was focusing more, working more, becoming more passionate about learning, and putting myself out there in ways that I was never comfortable with. It felt like a snowball effect.</p>
            <h2>What now?</h2>
            <p>Now, I'm just currently in the process of showing everyone of what I'm capable of. Not just with programming and designing, but in being a team player, and raising people's spirits.</p>
