            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Creativity and logic. My life has always centered around these two ideas. </p>
            <p>I cried over not getting a computer when I was younger, and from then on I knew I was destined to be heavily involved with computers in some shape or form. Ever since I was a child, my eyes would always light up when I saw some inspiring art piece, whether that be through paintings, drawings, writing, or even web applications. Once I realized that I could scratch that creative itch with web development, I decided to sit down and put all I could into learning this craft. 25 years late, of course.</p>
