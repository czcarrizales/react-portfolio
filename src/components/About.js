            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I'm a software developer based in California with experience working with MERN and MEAN stacks for website development. I am constantly looking at other's designs for inspiration, both with a frontend and backend mindset. Knowledge is key, and I'm always striving to learn about everything I can, whether it's code or non-code related. When I'm not an inch away from my computer screen hammering away at a project, I like to relax by listening to music with my noise-cancelling headphones or reading something that will teach me to be a more open-minded and fuller person. I love talking to people and gaining different perspectives, so feel free to reach out anytime through my email or Linkedin!</p>
